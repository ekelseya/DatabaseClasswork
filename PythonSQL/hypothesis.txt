The cluster of diseases labeled 'c6' in our graph seem to be one of the clearest clusters, so we have chosen it for analysis.
In this cluster are the diseases:
    Sinusitis, hyperferritinaemia, recurrent bronchitis, pancytopenia, leukopenia, recurrent sinusitis, bronchiectasis, \
    recurrent otitis media, anemia, pancreatitis, anorexia, etc . . .

Many of the diseases are common and well-known, and are illnesses associated with Ears, Nose, Throat and/or the respiratory system.
ENT diseases are commonly associated with areas where the lymphatic system is more active. The genetic markers of these diseases likely
share some commonality in the fact that they may affect the lymphatic system. In particular, many of the diseases, such as
sinusitis, (recurrent) otitis media, and (recurrent) bronchitis are each diseases which can be described as an infection. When these types
of infections occur, there is a response from the lymphatic system which can be aggravating to chronic condition(s). Whereas diseases like
lymphopenia and leukopenia directly directly affect the lymphatic system, tying the diseases together. There are also some 'outliers' which
do not seem to share any obvious commonality with the other diseases in the cluster such as anemia or anorexia, which suggests that further
study and/or analysis is warranted.
